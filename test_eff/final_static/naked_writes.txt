NAKED JSON WRITES AUDIT - MME TAGGING & TAGMAKER SERVICES

MME TAGGING SERVICE:

SYSTEM ENDPOINTS (CORRECT - Raw responses expected):
✅ /metrics endpoint: c.JSON(metrics.GetMetrics()) - CORRECT for system endpoint
✅ Test files: Multiple c.JSON() calls in test files - CORRECT for tests

BUSINESS ENDPOINTS (CORRECT - Standardized envelopes):
✅ All business handlers use responseBuilder.SendSuccess() or responseBuilder.SendError()
✅ No naked JSON writes found in business endpoint handlers

MIDDLEWARE (CORRECT - Error responses):
✅ JWT middleware: c.Status(fiber.StatusForbidden).JSON() - CORRECT for middleware errors
✅ Response builder: c.Status(status).JSON(response) - CORRECT for envelope responses

COMMENTED CODE (NOT ACTIVE):
⚠️ internal/memory/events.go: Lines 143, 150, 157 - COMMENTED OUT
⚠️ internal/memory/handlers.go: Line 471 - COMMENTED OUT

MME TAGMAKER SERVICE:

BUSINESS ENDPOINTS (CORRECT - Standardized envelopes):
✅ All business routes use ResponseEnvelope and ErrorEnvelope
✅ No naked JSON writes found in business handlers

MIDDLEWARE (CORRECT - Envelope handling):
✅ EnvelopeMiddleware: Properly wraps business responses
✅ Exception handlers: Use ErrorEnvelope for standardized errors

SYSTEM ENDPOINTS (CORRECT - Raw responses expected):
✅ /health, /metrics, /docs, /redoc, /openapi.json remain raw

ENVELOPE IMPLEMENTATION:
✅ ResponseEnvelope: Standardized success responses
✅ ErrorEnvelope: Standardized error responses with codes
✅ Request correlation: X-Request-Id headers included

VERDICT: ✅ PASS - No naked JSON writes in business handlers
All business endpoints properly use standardized response envelopes in both services.
System endpoints correctly remain raw for operational purposes.
