NAKED JSON WRITES AUDIT - MME TAGGING SERVICE

FINDINGS:
1. System endpoints correctly use naked JSON (expected):
   - /metrics endpoint: c.JSON(metrics.GetMetrics()) - CORRECT for system endpoint
   - Test files: Multiple c.JSON() calls in test files - CORRECT for tests

2. Business endpoints use standardized response builders:
   - All business handlers use responseBuilder.SendSuccess() or responseBuilder.SendError()
   - No naked JSON writes found in business endpoint handlers

3. JWT middleware uses naked JSON for error responses:
   - internal/http/middleware/jwt.go: Lines 107, 118 - CORRECT for middleware errors

4. Commented out code (not active):
   - internal/memory/events.go: Lines 143, 150, 157 - COMMENTED OUT
   - internal/memory/handlers.go: Line 471 - COMMENTED OUT

VERDICT: âœ… PASS - No naked JSON writes in business handlers
All business endpoints properly use standardized response envelopes.
